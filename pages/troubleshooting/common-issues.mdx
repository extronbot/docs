# Common issues

## The bot is offline.

This rarely happens but when it does it's usually for one of these reasons:

* Discord outage (check Discord status [here](https://status.discord.com))
* Server outage (check Extron's server status [here](https://extron.netlify.app/status))
* Scheduled bot maintenance (find out more info in [our support server](https://extron.netlify.app/support))

To get updates and find out the reason for this downtime, check the status channel in [our support server](https://extron.netlify.app/support). If there's no news about any outage, please notify a staff member.

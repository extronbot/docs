# Granting permissions

## Required permissions

Extron only asks for the minimum permissions she needs to work in your Discord server.

The permissions required to allow Extron to function correctly in your server are as follows:

* [x] View Channels
* [x] Send Messages
* [x] Manage Messages
* [x] Embed Links
* [x] Attach Files
* [x] Read Message History
* [x] Use External Emojis
* [x] Connect & Speak

<Caution>
These are the **only** permissions Extron requires to work in your server. If your server has granted higher permissions to her role or another role you have assigned to the bot, please make sure you [reset the permissions](granting-permissions.md#resetting-and-updating-extrons-permissions) or fix your role permissions.
</Caution>

## Restricting or disabling Extron commands

You can customize who can use Extron commands, which commands can be used, and in which channels. Start by logging into Discord in your browser or desktop app. Then navigate to Extron's settings under the "Integrations" tab in your Discord server's settings. Here you can fully manage permissions for the bot and for users based on commands, channels, roles and usernames.

## Resetting and updating Extron's permissions

Sometimes we add new features that may require more permissions. If this happens, we will notify you in our [support server](https://extron.netlify.app/support).

<Note>
To reset Extron's permissions [click here](https://extron.netlify.app/invite) and re-invite the bot to your server. This will overwrite the `@Extron` role permissions in your server without the need to kick the bot.
